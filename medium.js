A more realistic timeline for transition to tech while working full time is 2–3 years. This assumes 1 hour a day of work; approximately 700–1000 hours of study time. If you want to pass a technical interview or have a portfolio of work to show this might be a conservative estimate of time required. Some articles, like the first article I linked to for instance, had the time spent at 2500 hours for comparisons sake…",

Truthfully, I got into coding because I don’t like my job (I’m not yet employed in tech), I was curious about coding and tech generally, and somewhere deep down I always thought I might be good at coding.

You’ll also get introduced to a web framework with Bootstrap. You’ll learn about version control and maybe even collaboration on GitHub, so you’ll learn what it’s like to merge different versions of projects, with the joys and struggles that that can bring.

You can choose to specialize in front end or back end web development, or go in a different direction and start learning to use Python to analyze data for machine learning, among virtually infinite different options in your career as a developer. On the flip side, you now have to decide if being a developer is actually for you. It’s OK if it isn’t; tech is a big, diverse field. Maybe you want to be a user experience designer, maybe you want to be involved in research in the tech sector, maybe you want to be a sci-fi author. But this is a critical juncture and you need to decide if being a developer is actually what you want to do or not.",
